**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I'd say that the proper order of operations was where I struggled the most. 

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

Unfortunately, as my pair and I seemed to be having trouble with the same parts of GIT I didn't feel like I had much clarification. 

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked my pair about what order of operation they utilized or believed we should. 

**What still confuses you about Git?**

I'm still not 100% sure what would be the best order of operations for GIT workflow that both harnesses speed as well as accuracy. 

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I think it was good. I learned a bit about myself as a follower of directions as well as a leader and which role I feel more comfortable in presently.
